# Noise-Robust Speech Recognition using Wav2Vec2

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems trained on clean audio perform poorly in real-world noisy environments. This project improves speech recognition robustness by training a Wav2Vec2 model on clean and noise-augmented audio and evaluating performance under varying noise levels.
